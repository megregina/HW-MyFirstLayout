    <h1>Meghan Fraley, PhD</h1>
    <p>I am a licensed psychologist in California. I work with individual adults and adolescents in private practice in San Jose, CA. I also am actively engaged in grassroots organizing work addressing economic and social justice issues. I came to UX/UI design to integrate psychology and social justice with technology.<br /><br />Overall, my passion is to help people feel more connected to themselves and the people and world around them. My approach to therapy is warm, compassionate, and empowering. I support individuals in overcoming the obstacles that prevent them from living freely, authentically, and joyfully. My clinical specialties include: depression, anxiety, life transitions, spiritual/existential concerns, and women's issues.Â </p>
